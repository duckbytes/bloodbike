# front-end notes

- might be worth doing a general Wiki in case this project gets bigger
- starting with wireframes from slide deck presented to Tom's bootcamp

## tech stack

The front end will include:

- yarn
- React (via create-react-app)
- Redux, possibly, to manage component state
- Typescript (a stricter language should be used to aid maintenance down the line)
- connection to a Restful API, designed by the rest of the team

## how to get started on the front-end

git checkout the front-end branch
yarn install
yarn start to view the front-end in the browser
