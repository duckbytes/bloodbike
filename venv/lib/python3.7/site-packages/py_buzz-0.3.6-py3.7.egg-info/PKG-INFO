        That's not flying, it's falling with style: Exceptions with extras
        ------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        This package supplies some extras to python exceptions that may be useful
        within a python project. It is intended to supply some functionality that is
        often written over and over again in packages. Most of the features are
        relatively simple, but providing a consistent set of functionality is very
        convenient when dealing with exceptions within your projects.
        
        Buzz can be used as a stand-alone exception class, but it is best used as a
        base class for custom exceptions within a package. This allows the user to
        focus on creating a set of Exceptions that provide complete coverage for issues
        within their application without having to re-write convenience functions on
        their base Exception class
